# Load-a-van
Genetic algoritm for optimisation of the volume of the van for transporting household appliancies considering their price and trying to maximize it

for the purposes of this project we will use PyGAD library
we will consider van capacitiees from 1 to 5

----
A van in a shop must be filled to transport household appliances, its load must be optimized by maximizing
the value of what is transported for a given volume. We have a file with occupied space, price and quantity of certain products
